**Airport Queue Simulator** ✈️
**Overview**

This project simulates a runway sequence of airplanes landing and taking off using queues to model realistic scheduling behavior. The simulation is brought to life with animations powered by timers, giving a clear visual representation of runway operations.

A Graphical User Interface enables users to interact with the simulation by adding new aircraft into the queue, observing how the system prioritizes takeoffs and landings in real time.

**Features**

🛫 Queue-based scheduling for takeoffs and landings.
⏱ Timer-driven animations for smooth aircraft movement on the runway.
🖥 Interactive GUI allowing user input of new aircraft.
🎥 Real-time visualization of runway operations.
